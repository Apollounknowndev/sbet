**Subjectively Better Enchantment Tooltips** is a mod that reformats the tooltips for enchantments to be more in line with the tooltips for armor trims!

## Description

The armor trim tooltip looks like this:

It looks pretty great! This mod changes enchantment tooltips to be formatted like armor trim tooltips are.

By default, regular enchantments will have a green color, treasure enchantments will have a magenta color, and cursed enchantments will have a red color. Don't like these color choices? Open the config file named `subjectively-better-enchantment-tooltips.json` and change the colors to your heart's content. The colors are in decimal values.
